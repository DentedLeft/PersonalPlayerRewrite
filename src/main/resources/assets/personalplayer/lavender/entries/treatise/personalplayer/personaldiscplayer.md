The Personal Disc Player can be used to play Music Discs privately.

<recipe;personalplayer:personal_disc_player>

The disc player can be loaded and unloaded similar to the Bundle.

Once a disc is inserted, music can be played and stopped by using <keybind;key.use> while the item is in the hotbar.


Music will stop if the disc player is inserted into a container or removed from the player inventory while playing.
